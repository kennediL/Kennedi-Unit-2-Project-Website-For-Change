            <p class="SectionD"> There are seven types of domestic violence which are physical, sexual, emotional, spiritual, cultural, verbal, and financial. Physical domestic violence is when someone intentionally causes bodily injury. Sexual domestic violence is when a sexual behavior or act is forced upon someone without their consent. Emotional abuse is when someone non-physically belittles the victim into feeling threatened, ashamed, inferior, or degraded. Spiritual and Cultural abuse is when someone uses their spiritual, religious, or cultural beliefs to hurt, scare or control you. Verbal abuse is when someone uses their words to manipulate, intimidate, and maintain power over someone else. Economic abuse is when someone manages someone else’s money and finances. </p>

            <p class="sectiong"> To prepare to get away from your abuser, you must know that you are making the right decision. Second, you should talk to a trustworthy friend or family member to see if they can help you get away. Make sure you have saved money and a well-thought-out plan. In your plan make sure your safety is prioritized. If you can talk to an local victim advocate in private so they can also help you plan. Make sure you are considering your phone privacy. Research the domestic local shelters nearby, and memorize the important phone numbers. While you prepare make sure you have all of your important information such as identification and records and also make sure to grab your necessities.
